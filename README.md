# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

This project performs a statistical analysis of production data for the MechaCar. The first section presents a multiple linear regression to predict fuel efficiency of MechaCar prototypes. The second and third sections analyze suspension coil metrics to determine if the consistency of manufacturing at different sites. Finally, I propose a statistical study that could be used to compare the performance of MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other competitors.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

A multiple linear regression to determine the impact of a range of metrics on the miles per gallon of MechaCar prototypes produced the following results:

- The factors that contribute the most non-random variance to MPG are vehicle length and ground clearance.
- The model produces an R-squared value of 0.71. The p-value of the linear regression is 5.35 x 10<sup>-11</sup>, which is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05%. This is sufficient to reject the null hypothesis that the slope of the linear model is zero.
- The resulting R-squared value means that the linear can predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes with 71% effectiveness. This is better than random chance, but it is clear that there are still significant factors that are not accounted for in this model.
